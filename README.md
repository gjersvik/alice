# Alice
Personal AI assistant that learns from you and helps you.

## Getting Started

This is currently a frontend-only app using Vite. Run it with:
`npm run dev`

## Current Status
Not even an ideaâ€”more like the idea of an idea.

## Vision
Alice is a personal AI assistant that remembers and learns from you. It can do tasks for you, but you are in control.

### Local First, Private First
You can run Alice completely in the browser without any backend. It starts out as private as possible. You make an active choice to trade privacy for convenience by connecting to backends and integrations.

- You can run in the browser only.
- You can host the backend yourself.
- You can use a hosted solution in full or in part.

### The AI Can Only Propose
The AI has no access or ability to do anything directly. It can only propose solutions that you can accept, edit, or reject. The solution is then run in a workflow engine that has no "intelligence."

### Nothing Up My Sleeve
You can see and edit what the AI knows. If you get a weird result, you can review every step of your reply, all the system prompts, user prompt and data.

## Contributions

I am not looking for contributors or issues right now. Feel free to fork, but do not expect anything to run at this early stage.
